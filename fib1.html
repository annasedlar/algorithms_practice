<!-- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. -->


a loop that keeps running until boolean.  (when i > 4mil)
inside the loop: 
	add the previous number to the current number to get the new number
	once we have new number, check to see if it's even
	if it's even, put it in the array/pile to be summed

<script type = "text/javascript">
	var belowFourMil = true;
	var a = 1;
	var b = 2; 
	var sum = 0;
	var temp = 0;

	while(belowFourMil){
		var temp = a + b; //this is the new number, the new 'b'
		a, b, temp
		sum = 2;
		a = b; //set the previous number to the recent number
		b = temp; //set the recent number to the new number
		// we need to check if temp is divisble by 2 (even) thus %2
		if(temp %2 === 0){
			sum += temp;
		}
		if (temp > 4000000){
			belowFourMil = false;
		}
		console.log(temp)
	}
	console.log(sum); //4,613,730
